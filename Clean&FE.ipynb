    "Clock data is unreliable because maybe 25% of the games have only have one time for each play, and that time is when the drive started. I played with trying to predict time per play based on play type, but the data was very messy. So I decided to get the total time of each drive, and then assume each play took the same amount of time. EPA shouldn't be significantly affected most of the time, i.e. a 70 yard pass will be considered a good play no matter what. The only time it might have an adverse effect is toward the end of a game, when seconds matter. I think that in college football, when the clock stops for a first down, and incompletions, that all pass plays probably do take a somewhat similar amount of time. Drives in this situation will consist mostly of the same play type, and plays of the same play type likely take similar amounts of time. I'll compare it to the clock data I do have to make sure."
